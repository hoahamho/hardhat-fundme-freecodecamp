# Hardhat FundMe FreeCodeCamp

This is my first repo follow the Javascript Blockchain/Smart Contract FreeCodeCamp Course, lesson 7.

# Some note:

1. The most headache problem i got is described and solve in this link: "https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/129275/typeerror-cannot-read-property-length-of-undefined-while-deploying-using-ha"

2. Still don't know the pros and conts between these two:

```shell
yarn hardhat deploy
```

VS

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts
```
